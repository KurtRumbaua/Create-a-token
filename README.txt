# Project Title

MyToken is a basic digital currency (cryptocurrency) that can be created (minted) and destroyed (burned). It demonstrates how digital assets can be tracked and managed on a blockchain.

## Description

MyToken is a simplified representation of a digital currency (cryptocurrency) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It showcases the essential mechanisms behind how these tokens function, providing a foundation for understanding more complex token economies. Users can create new MyTokens through a minting process, increasing the total supply in circulation. Conversely, they can also destroy existing tokens through burning, reducing the overall supply. Each user's token balance is meticulously tracked, ensuring transparency and security. This contract serves as an educational tool and a starting point for developers who are exploring the world of blockchain and decentralized finance.
